# SpectateTP

This is a simple plugin to solve a simple problem.

Players can normally use spectator mode to teleport to anyone without permission (using the number keys). However, spectator mode can be useful, so disabling it shouldn't be the only option.

This plugin prevents players from teleporting with spectator mode, unless they have the permission: ```spectatetp.tp```

The message players receive if they are denied can be changed in the config.
